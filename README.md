# Dhananjay Chauhan — Personal e-Portfolio

## How to deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repository named: `your-username.github.io`
2. Copy the files (`index.html`, `about.html`, `skills.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`) into the repo root.
3. Commit & push to the `main` branch.
4. Wait a minute and open: `https://your-username.github.io`

## Edit content
- Replace project placeholders in `projects.html` when you're ready.
- Update `contact.html` if you want a contact form integration.

## Notes
- If you want a downloadable resume, upload `resume.pdf` and add a link to `index.html` and/or `about.html`.
- If you'd like a form that emails you, I can add Formspree or Netlify Forms integration.
